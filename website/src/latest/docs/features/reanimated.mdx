# React Native Reanimated

Re.Pack provides first-class support for [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) through a dedicated plugin that simplifies integration and optimizes build performance.

:::warning title="This plugin is primarily intended for Rspack users."

The main purpose of this plugin is to limit the **build performance impact** of the `react-native-reanimated` babel plugin.

If you're using webpack with `babel-loader`, you probably don't need this plugin. Instead, you should follow the [official Reanimated documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started/#step-2-add-reanimateds-babel-plugin) and add the Reanimated Babel plugin directly to your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ["module:@react-native/babel-preset"],
  plugins: ["react-native-reanimated/plugin"],
};
```

## How It Works

### The Problem

React Native Reanimated requires a special Babel plugin to transform your code, particularly functions marked with `'worklet'`. 
This transformation is necessary but comes with a cost - the babel transformation can slow down your build process significantly 
when applied to all files. With Rspack under the hood, we want to make sure that we use `babel-loader` only as a last resort.

### The Solution

Our plugin takes a smarter approach by only applying the Reanimated transformation to files that actually need it:

- **Smart Detection**: Before running babel, we scan files for Reanimated keywords like `worklet`
- **Targeted Processing**: Only files containing these keywords go through the transformation
- **Performance Boost**: Everything else skips this heavy processing step

In simple terms: we make your builds faster by only doing the heavy Reanimated processing where it's actually needed.

## Installation

If you haven't already, install the `react-native-reanimated` package:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install react-native-reanimated" />

To add Reanimated support to your Re.Pack project with Rspack, install the plugin:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @callstack/repack-plugin-reanimated" />

## Usage

### Plugin Configuration

Add the plugin to your Rspack configuration file (`rspack.config.js`):

```js title="rspack.config.cjs"
const Repack = require("@callstack/repack");
const { ReanimatedPlugin } = require("@callstack/repack-plugin-reanimated");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
      new Repack.RepackPlugin(),
      new ReanimatedPlugin(),
    ],
};
```

# Quick start

## Pre-requisites

If you're already familiar with JavaScript, React Native and webpack, then you'll be able to get moving quickly! Otherwise, it's highly recommended to get yourself familiar with these topic and then come back here:

- [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Webpack concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

## Minimum requirements

- Node >= 20
- React Native >= 0.77.0

:::note On React Native Version

The absolute minimum required version of React Native is 0.74.0, which contains fixes enabling proper SWC transpilation. While versions lower than 0.74 might work, they will most likely only function with Webpack.

:::

:::info Version Support Policy

Re.Pack is designed to work with the latest React Native version and maintains backward compatibility with the two previous versions. 
While older versions might work, they are not officially supported. 

If you're interested in fixing compatibility issues for older versions, feel free to open a PR!

## Installation

To create a new React Native project with Re.Pack or adapt an existing one:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npx @callstack/repack-init",
  yarn: "yarn dlx @callstack/repack-init",
  pnpm: "pnpm dlx @callstack/repack-init",
  bun: "bunx @callstack/repack-init",
}} />

In case the command above didn't work for any reason, you can follow the manual migration guide [here](/docs/migration-guides/metro).

:::tip The defaults work well for most projects
If you need custom settings (like additional loaders or plugins), check out our [configuration guide](/docs/guides/configuration).

## Usage

Now that you have Re.Pack configured, you should be able to use Re.Pack's development server and bundle your application.

### Running development server

When developing your application, you want to run Re.Pack's development server to compile your source code with Rspack/webpack.

To start the development server, you can use React Native Community CLI and run:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm run react-native start",
  yarn: "yarn react-native start",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native start",
  bun: "bun react-native start",
}} />

To learn about `start` command, check out the [start command documentation](/api/cli/start.mdx).

### Bundling the app

When you are building the release version of your application, Re.Pack will be picked up automatically as the bundler. In case you want to create bundle manually, **the recommended way is to use React Native Community CLI** and run:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm run react-native bundle",
  yarn: "yarn react-native bundle",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native bundle",
  bun: "bun react-native bundle",
}} />

To learn about `bundle` command, check out the [bundle command documentation](/api/cli/bundle.mdx).

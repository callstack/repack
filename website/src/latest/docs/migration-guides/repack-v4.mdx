# Migrating from Re.Pack 4

:::info title="Re.Pack 5 now supports Rspack!"
Re.Pack 5 introduces support for [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), 
a high-performance webpack alternative with a highly compatible API. 
This migration guide focuses solely on migrating from **V4** to **V5** while continuing to use webpack. 

If you're interested in using Rspack (which is encouraged), we recommend first completing the migration 
to **V5** with webpack and then following our separate webpack to Rspack migration guide.
:::

## Update dependencies in `package.json`

The first step is to update the Re.Pack in the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-    "@callstack/repack": "4.x.x"
+    "@callstack/repack": "~5.0.0"
  }
}
```

You can also remove `babel-loader` from your `devDependencies` as Re.Pack 5 now includes it by default:

```diff
{
  "devDependencies": {
-    "babel-loader": "^9.1.3"
  }
}
```

:::tip title="Good time to update webpack and terser-webpack-plugin"

While not necessary, for the best experience with Re.Pack 5, 
we recommend updating your `webpack` and `terser-webpack-plugin` dependencies to their latest versions:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.98.0",
    "terser-webpack-plugin": "^5.3.11"
  }
}
```

:::

After updating the project dependencies, run the install command of your package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install" />

## Update `react-native.config.js`

Since Re.Pack 5 now supports multiple bundlers (webpack and Rspack), 
you need to specify that you want to use webpack commands explicitly. 
Update your `react-native.config.js` in a following way:

```diff
module.exports = {
-  commands: require('@callstack/repack/commands'),
+  commands: require('@callstack/repack/commands/webpack'),
};
```

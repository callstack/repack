# Migrating from Re.Pack 4

:::info
Re.Pack 5 introduces support for [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/), 
a high-performance webpack alternative with a highly compatible API. 
This migration guide focuses solely on migrating from **V4** to **V5** while continuing to use webpack. 

If you're interested in using Rspack (which is encouraged), we recommend first completing the migration 
to **V5** with webpack and then following our separate webpack to Rspack migration guide.

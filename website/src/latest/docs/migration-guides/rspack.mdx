# Migrating to Rspack

This guide will help you migrate your React Native project from using Webpack to Rspack with Re.Pack.

:::warning title="Migrate to Re.Pack 5 first!"

If your project is using version 4 of Re.Pack, you need to migrate it to use Re.Pack 5 first.

See the [Migration from Re.Pack 4 guide](/docs/migration-guides/repack-v4) for more details.

:::tip title="Why migrate to Rspack?"

[Rspack](https://rspack.dev/) is a fast Rust-based bundler that's compatible with the webpack ecosystem, offering significantly faster build times for both development and production while maintaining webpack compatibility with minimal migration effort.
For more details on why Rspack was created and its advantages, see the [official rationale](https://rspack.dev/guide/start/introduction#why-rspack).
:::

## Update dependencies in `package.json`

To use Rspack, you'll need to update your dependencies by adding the following:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rspack/core @swc/helpers" />

## Update `react-native.config.js`

Since Re.Pack now supports multiple bundlers, you need to specify that you want to use Rspack commands explicitly.
Update your `react-native.config.js` file to use Rspack commands:

```diff title="react-native.config.js"
module.exports = {
-  commands: require('@callstack/repack/commands/webpack'),
+  commands: require('@callstack/repack/commands/rspack'),
};
```

## Updating configuration

### 1. Rename your configuration file

Rename your configuration file to match the Rspack convention:

- ðŸ“„ `webpack.config.js` â†’ `rspack.config.js`
- ðŸ“„ `webpack.config.mjs` â†’ `rspack.config.mjs`
- ðŸ“„ `webpack.config.cjs` â†’ `rspack.config.cjs`

### 2. Update your configuration

When migrating from webpack to Rspack, you'll need to make several changes to your configuration file.

:::warning title="Additional steps may be required for complex configurations"
The modifications outlined below cover the basic changes needed for most React Native projects. However, if you have a more complex webpack setup with custom loaders, plugins, or configurations, these changes might not be sufficient.

For more advanced migration scenarios, refer to the [official Rspack migration guide](https://rspack.dev/guide/migration/webpack), which provides detailed instructions for migrating various webpack features, plugins, and loaders to their Rspack equivalents.
:::

#### Remove `TerserPlugin` import and configuration

Rspack uses [SwcJsMinimizerRspackPlugin](https://rspack.dev/plugins/rspack/swc-js-minimizer-rspack-plugin) for minification, which is much faster than `TerserPlugin` and comes configured by default. You can remove both the `TerserPlugin` import and its configuration.

```diff
- const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');
  const Repack = require('@callstack/repack');

  module.exports = (env) => {
    return {
-     optimization: {
-       minimizer: [
-         new TerserPlugin({
-           test: /\.(js)?bundle(\?.*)?$/i,
-           extractComments: false,
-           terserOptions: {
-             format: {
-               comments: false,
-             },
-           },
-         }),
-       ],
-     },
    };
  };
```

#### Replace `babel-loader` with `getJsTransformRules`

Rspack uses SWC for transpilation instead of Babel. The `getJsTransformRules()` helper function configures all necessary JavaScript/TypeScript transformation rules.

```diff
module: {
  rules: [
-   {
-     test: /\.[cm]?[jt]sx?$/,
-     use: 'babel-loader',
-     type: 'javascript/auto',
-   },
+   ...Repack.getJsTransformRules(),
    ...Repack.getAssetTransformRules(),
  ],
},
```

:::info title="About getJsTransformRules"
The `getJsTransformRules()` function returns the default rules for transforming JavaScript and TypeScript files using SWC. It handles both your application code and `node_modules`, and is functionally equivalent to the official `@react-native/babel-preset`. For more details, see the [API documentation for getJsTransformRules](/api/utils/get-js-transform-rules).
:::

#### Configure Flow support (if needed)

If your project uses [Flow](https://flow.org/) for type checking, you'll need to add a dedicated loader since SWC (used by Rspack) doesn't support Flow natively. Re.Pack provides a `@callstack/repack/flow-loader` to strip Flow type annotations from your code. Add the following rule to your module configuration:

```diff title="rspack.config.cjs"
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...Repack.getJsTransformRules(),
      ...Repack.getAssetTransformRules(),
+     {
+       test: /\.jsx?$/,
+       type: 'javascript/auto',
+       exclude: /node_modules/,
+       use: {
+         loader: '@callstack/repack/flow-loader',
+         options: { all: true },
+       },
+     },
    ],
  },
};
```

:::tip title="Flow-typed libraries"

There is no need to configure Flow support for libraries since `getJsTransformRules` handles them out of the box. In rare cases, you may need to configure Flow support for unhandled libraries. 

For more details, see our [Flow support documentation](/docs/features/flow-support).
:::

#### Use `@callstack/repack-plugin-reanimated`

If your project uses `react-native-reanimated`, we provide an official plugin to ensure optimal performance when bundling with Rspack.

To add the Re.Pack Reanimated plugin to your project:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @callstack/repack-plugin-reanimated" />

Then update your Rspack configuration file to include the plugin:

```js title="rspack.config.js"
const Repack = require('@callstack/repack');
const ReanimatedPlugin = require('@callstack/repack-plugin-reanimated');

module.exports = (env) => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      new Repack.RepackPlugin(),
      new ReanimatedPlugin(),
    ],
  };
};
```

For more details on using Reanimated with Re.Pack & Rspack, see our [Reanimated support](/docs/features/reanimated) page.

## Running your app

After migration, you can run the development server using the same command as before:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npx react-native start",
  yarn: "yarn react-native start",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native start",
  bun: "bun react-native start",
}} />

Same goes for creating a production bundle:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npx react-native bundle",
  yarn: "yarn react-native bundle",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native bundle",
  bun: "bun react-native bundle",
}} />

:::tip title="Having trouble?"

If you are having trouble migrating to Rspack reach out and open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/callstack/repack/issues/new/choose).
:::

## Cleanup

After successfully migrating to Rspack and confirming that your app runs correctly, you can remove webpack-related dependencies that are no longer needed:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm uninstall webpack terser-webpack-plugin",
  yarn: "yarn remove webpack terser-webpack-plugin",
  pnpm: "pnpm remove webpack terser-webpack-plugin",
  bun: "bun remove webpack terser-webpack-plugin"
}} />

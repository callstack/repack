# Configuration

Re.Pack uses the same configuration system as Rspack and webpack. This means you can leverage the extensive configuration options from either of the bundlers while working with React Native projects. Re.Pack comes with minimal, development & production-ready defaults that work out of the box, but as your project grows, you may need to customize various aspects of the bundling process.

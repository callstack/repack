# Quick start

## Pre-requisites

If you're already familiar with JavaScript, React Native and Webpack, then you'll be able to get moving quickly! Otherwise, it's highly recommended to get yourself familiar with these topic and then come back here:

- [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Webpack concepts](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)

## Installation

To create a new React Native project with Re.Pack or adapt an existing one:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npx @callstack/repack-init",
  yarn: "yarn dlx @callstack/repack-init",
  pnpm: "pnpm dlx @callstack/repack-init",
  bun: "bunx @callstack/repack-init",
}} />

In case the command above didn't work for any reason, you can follow the manual installation steps [here](/docs/getting-started/manual-installation).

:::info
The default configuration works for most projects, but if you need custom settings (like additional loaders or plugins), check out our [configuration guide](/docs/guides/configuration).
:::

## Usage

Now that you have Re.Pack configured, you should be able to use Re.Pack's development server and bundle your application.

### Running development server

When developing your application, you want to run Re.Pack's development server to compile your source code with Rspack/webpack.

To start the development server, you can use React Native Community CLI and run:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm run react-native start",
  yarn: "yarn react-native start",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native start",
  bun: "bun react-native start",
}} />

To learn about `start` command, check out the [`start`](/api/cli/start.mdx)'s command documentation.

### Bundling the app

When building the release version of your application Re.Pack will bundle your application automatically if you either:
- Used the automatic installation, or
- Followed the manual installation steps for [Configure XCode](./manual-installation.mdx#4-configure-xcode) and [Configure Android](./manual-installation.mdx#5-configure-android)

If you want to create bundle manually (development or production), **the recommended way is to use React Native Community CLI and run**:

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm run react-native bundle",
  yarn: "yarn react-native bundle",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native bundle",
  bun: "bun react-native bundle",
}} />

To learn about `bundle` command, check out the [`bundle`](/api/cli/bundle.mdx)'s command documentation.

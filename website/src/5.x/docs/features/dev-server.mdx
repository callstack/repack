# DevServer

Re.Pack 5 has it's own dev server that contain all features as Metro packager does, or even more in some cases.

## Usage

To start the dev server, you can use the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from 'rspress/theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command={{
  npm: "npm run react-native start",
  yarn: "yarn react-native start",
  pnpm: "pnpm react-native start",
  bun: "bun react-native start",
}} />

To get the full list of options available, check out the [`start`](/api/cli/start.md)'s command documentation.

:::info

The command is started through the React Native Community CLI's `start` command, which is overridden [inside `react-native.config.js`](../getting-started/quick-start.mdx#2-commands) to spawn Re.Pack's dev server.

## Features

Re.Pack's dev server supports both Rspack and webpack and provides essential development features:

- **Fast Bundling**: Uses Rspack/webpack for efficient JavaScript bundling
- **Hot Reloading**: Instantly reflects code changes in the app
- **Source Maps**: Enables proper debugging with source code mapping
- **Multiple Platforms**: Supports both iOS and Android development
- **Module Federation**: Enables dynamic loading of remote modules
- **Development Tools**: Integrated with React Native DevTools
- **Asset Management**: Handles images, fonts and other assets

:::info
Re.Pack automatically handles ADB reverse port forwarding for Android development. When starting the dev server, it will wait for devices to be connected (`adb wait-for-device`) and then automatically run `adb reverse` on all connected Android devices. This ensures reliable communication between the devices and the development server across all connected Android devices.

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can use various keyboard shortcuts inside a terminal to interact with the dev server.

| Key | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `r` | Reloads the app on connected device/simulator |
| `d` | Opens the developer menu (same as shaking device) |
| `j` | Opens the [React Native DevTools](./devtools.md) for debugging and profiling |
| `a` | Runs `adb reverse` to enable communication between Android device and dev server |
